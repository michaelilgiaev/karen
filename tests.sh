# Self-bootstrapping: creates cache/venv if missing, installs tests/requirements.txt into
# it, runs pytest. Nothing global is touched; the venv is gitignored under cache/ (the same
# scratch root compile.sh and clear.sh use). pip is skipped when requirements.txt is
# unchanged.
#
# The tests are PURE and OFFLINE. They never hit the Anthropic API (a fake transport is
# injected), never reach the network. Git IS exercised, but only against throwaway repos
# created under pytest's tmp_path -- nothing in your real repos is ever touched or committed.
#
# Any arguments are passed straight through to pytest, e.g.:
#   bash tests.sh -k version        run only tests matching "version"
#   bash tests.sh -q                quiet
#   bash tests.sh tests/test_message.py
